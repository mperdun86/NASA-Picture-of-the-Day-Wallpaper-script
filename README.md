# NASA-Picture-of-the-Day-Wallpaper-script
A simple python script that grabs a random image from the NASA API, and replaces your desktop wallpaper with it.
The script will create a text log reposting the success or failure of the call, and will save the images it retrieves.

---TO USE---
Simply change the API_KEY and DOWNLOAD_DIR to your NASA API key, and the directory to where you want the images saved.

Peace, Love, and Code
